                    <p>Let's take a step back. What is this number that has been exalted with its own holiday? To start, pi is the English spelling of the Greek letter &pi; and is usually pronounced in English identically to “pie.” In math class, it is just a number. In a certain light, it's no more special than 2 or 78.163. But let's pause on those numbers. The number 2 appears all the time. You've probably had to count to 2 within the last hour! What about 78.163 though? Can you even say with confidence that you've ever experienced that number before in your life? It sits just as innocently on a number line as 2, yet it doesn't have the same utility.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                 So how did this business of &pi; come about? It's even harder to pinpoint on a number line than 78.163, yet the number &pi; actually does show up from time to time—in school, on TV, in the news...anywhere someone might be talking about maths or science. This is because the number &pi; has an important relationship to a circle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                 If you ask students what they can measure about a circle, two common responses are the circumference and the diameter, though they may not use those words. We can teach this enigmatic number even to very young children because of this connection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                 When you “unroll” a circle, you get a length a little more than 3 times the diameter; this is &pi;. In other words, &pi; equals the ratio between the circumference and diameter of a circle. Mathematicians since the dawn of history have been trying to calculate just what is that number?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                 Nowadays it's a well-known fact that the number is &pi; about 3.14. But oh, there is so much wrapped into that word "about." First off, it's not exactly any decimal you can write. This is probably the fact for which it's most famous. It's not exactly equal to 3.14 or 3.1415 or 3.14159265358979. It's what's known as an irrational number because the decimal expansion never repeats or ends. However, &pi; is not the only irrational number. In fact, there are in a way even more irrational numbers than rational numbers! So what makes &pi; so special?

                Pi may be a famous irrational number, but there is nothing irrational about celebrating it with your students! Even though there are infinitely many irrational numbers, very few of them have infiltrated popular culture—and none in the way that pi has, with memorization competitions, a perfume, and even an eponymous movie. It probably doesn't hurt either that "pi" sounds like "pie," making way for an especially tasty mathematical celebration.

                Pi Day is celebrated every year, 14 March, around the world. Pi (Greek letter &pi;) is the symbol used in mathematics to represent a constant — the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter — which is approximately 3.14159. To date, pi has been calculated to more than 1 trillion decimal places—and the mathematicians don't plan on stopping there. As an irrational and transcendental number, it will continue infinitely without repetition or pattern. While only a handful of digits are needed for typical calculations, Pi's infinite nature makes it a fun challenge to memorize, and to computationally calculate more and more digits.
