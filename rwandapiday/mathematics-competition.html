                    <p>At each stage, the test consists of 30 multiple-choice questions. For each of the questions mark with cross (x) the alternative answer which you find is true. If you, at some point, want to change the marking add a clear note. Only one of the alternatives A, B, C, D and E is true. No calculators, cellphones nor other electronic devices are allowed in the test. Only paper, pen, eraser, straightedge and compass. 
                                </p>
                    <p>Please do not make any calculation on the problem pages. Those are only for answers. For your own calculations use scratch papers. Students' movements in the test room are not allowed after the exam started. Students communicating with each other during the test will be removed from the room.
