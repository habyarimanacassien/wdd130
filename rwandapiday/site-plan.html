      <h4>What Is Pi?</h4>
      <p>Let's take a step back. What is this number that has been exalted with its own holiday? To start, pi is the English spelling of the Greek letter &pi; and is usually pronounced in English identically to “pie.” In math class, it is just a number. In a certain light, it's no more special than 2 or 78.163. But let's pause on those numbers. The number 2 appears all the time. You've probably had to count to 2 within the last hour! What about 78.163 though? Can you even say with confidence that you've ever experienced that number before in your life? It sits just as innocently on a number line as 2, yet it doesn't have the same utility.
        </p>
        <p>
       So how did this business of &pi; come about? It's even harder to pinpoint on a number line than 78.163, yet the number &pi; actually does show up from time to time—in school, on TV, in the news...anywhere someone might be talking about maths or science. This is because the number &pi; has an important relationship to a circle.
       </p>
       <p>
       If you ask students what they can measure about a circle, two common responses are the circumference and the diameter, though they may not use those words. We can teach this enigmatic number even to very young children because of this connection.
       </p>
  
       <p>
       When you “unroll” a circle, you get a length a little more than 3 times the diameter; this is &pi;. In other words, &pi; equals the ratio between the circumference and diameter of a circle. Mathematicians since the dawn of history have been trying to calculate just what is that number?
       </p>
       <p>
       Nowadays it's a well-known fact that the number is &pi; about 3.14. But oh, there is so much wrapped into that word "about." First off, it's not exactly any decimal you can write. This is probably the fact for which it's most famous. It's not exactly equal to 3.14 or 3.1415 or 3.14159265358979. It's what's known as an irrational number because the decimal expansion never repeats or ends. However, &pi; is not the only irrational number. In fact, there are in a way even more irrational numbers than rational numbers! So what makes &pi; so special?
      </p>

      <h4>What Is Pi Day?</h4>
      <p>
      Pi may be a famous irrational number, but there is nothing irrational about celebrating it with your students! Even though there are infinitely many irrational numbers, very few of them have infiltrated popular culture—and none in the way that pi has, with memorization competitions, a perfume, and even an eponymous movie. It probably doesn't hurt either that "pi" sounds like "pie," making way for an especially tasty mathematical celebration.</p>
      <p>
      Pi Day is celebrated every year, 14 March, around the world. Pi (Greek letter &pi;) is the symbol used in mathematics to represent a constant — the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter — which is approximately 3.14159. To date, pi has been calculated to more than 1 trillion decimal places—and the mathematicians don't plan on stopping there. As an irrational and transcendental number, it will continue infinitely without repetition or pattern. While only a handful of digits are needed for typical calculations, Pi's infinite nature makes it a fun challenge to memorize, and to computationally calculate more and more digits.

      <h3>Mathematics Competition</h3>
      <h4>2023 Rwanda Mathematics Competition</h4>
      <p>The Pi Day Mathematics Competition is an opportunity for secondary/ high school students in Rwanda's schools majoring in Mathematics to explore the fun side of mathematics. The students compete in three stages from district level to national level. The district level competition will determine the top students from the participated ones who will go to provincial level. The top students from the proncial competition advance to the final round, which is the national competition.</p> 
      <h4>Rules and Regulations</h4>
      <p>At each stage, the test consists of 30 multiple-choice questions. For each of the questions mark with cross (x) the alternative answer which you find is true. If you, at some point, want to change the marking add a clear note. Only one of the alternatives A, B, C, D and E is true.</p>
      <p>No calculators, cellphones nor other electronic devices are allowed in the test. Only paper, pen, eraser, straightedge and compass.</p>
      <p> Please do not make any calculation on the problem pages. Those are only for answers. For your own calculations use scratch papers.</p>
      <p>Students' movements in the test room are not allowed after the exam started. Students communicating with each other during the test will be removed from the room.</p>
      <p>The total time allowed for the test is 3 hours.</p>
      <h4>Competition venue</h4>
      <p>The venue for both competition levels will be communicated at least 7 days before the competition took place.</p>
      <h4>Prizes</h4>
      <p>Certificates of Participation will be given to all participants in the final stage. More prestigious prizes will be awarded to finalists (top 5 girls and 5 boys) at an award ceremony to be held immediately after the completion of the Final round on 14 March.</p>
      <h4>Frequently asked questions</h4>
      <p>Is any secondary student allowed to come in the competition?</p>

      <h3>Pi Day Celebration Ceremony</h3>
      <h4>Pi day timeline</h4>
      <h5>1988 First public celebration of Pi Day</h5>
      <p>March 14 marks Pi Day, an annual celebration of the mathematical sign pi. Founded in 1988 by physicist Larry Shaw, March 14 was selected because the numerical date (3.14) represents the first three digits of pi, and it also happens to be Albert Einstein's birthday.

      The first Pi Day celebration took place at the Exploratorium (Shaw's place of work), a San Francisco-based interactive science museum, and featured a circular parade and the eating of fruit pies. The Exploratorium continues to hold Pi Day celebrations.</p>
      <h5>1995</h5> 
      <p>House of Representatives recognizes Pi Day.</p>
      <h5>March 12, 2009</h5>
      <p>On March 12, 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a non-binding resolution (111 H. Res. 224), recognizing March 14, 2009, as National Pi Day.
"Whereas Pi can be approximated as 3.14, and thus March 14, 2009, is an appropriate day for 'National Pi Day': Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
(1) supports the designation of a 'Pi Day' and its celebration around the world;
(2) recognizes the continuing importance of National Science Foundation's maths and science education programs; and
(3) encourages schools and educators to observe the day with appropriate activities that teach students about Pi and engage them about the study of mathematics."</p>

      <h5>2012</h5>
      <p>Massachusetts Institute of Technology has often mailed its application decision letters to prospective students for delivery on Pi Day. Starting in 2012, MIT has announced it will post those decisions (privately) online on Pi Day at exactly 6:28 pm, which they have called "Tau Time", to honor the rival numbers pi and tau equally. In 2015, the regular decisions were put online at 9:26 am, following that year's "pi minute", and in 2020, regular decisions were released at 1:59 pm, making the first six digits of pi.</p>
      <h5>March 2014</h5>
      <p>The entire month of March 2014 (3/14) was observed by some as "Pi Month". In the year 2015, March 14 was celebrated as "Super Pi Day". It had special significance, as the date is written as 3/14/15 in month/day/year format. At 9:26:53, the date and time together represented the first 10 digits of π, and later that second Pi Instant represented all of &pi;'s digits.</p>
      <h5>14th March 2018</h5>
      <p>The University of Rwanda (UR) in collaboration with the African Institute of Mathematical Sciences (AIMS)-Kigali, the UR-Sweden Programme, the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (EAIFR-ICTP) and IMAGINARY - open mathematics organizes the first celebration of the Pi-day in Rwanda on 14th March 2018.</p>
      <h5>2019</h5>
      <p>Google breaks world record for calculating pi digits</p>

      <h5>Alternative dates</h5>
      <p>Pi Day is most frequently observed on March 14 (3/14 in the month/day format) since 3, 1, and 4 are the first three significant figures of π, but related celebrations have been held on alternative dates.</p>
      <p>
Pi Approximation Day is observed on July 22 (22/7 in the day/month format), since the fraction 22/7 is a common approximation of &pi;, which is accurate to two decimal places and dates from Archimedes.</p>
<p>
Two Pi Day, also known as Tau Day for the mathematical constant tau, which is approximated as 6.28, is observed on June 28 (6/28 in the month/day format).</p>
<p>
Pi Approximation Day is also observed on the 10th of November since it is the 314th day of the year.</p>
