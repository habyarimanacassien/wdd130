                <h2>1988 First public celebration of Pi Day</h2>
                <p>March 14 marks Pi Day, an annual celebration of the mathematical sign pi. Founded in 1988 by physicist Larry Shaw, March 14 was selected because the numerical date (3.14) represents the first three digits of pi, and it also happens to be Albert Einstein's birthday.</p>
          
                <p>The first Pi Day celebration took place at the Exploratorium (Shaw's place of work), a San Francisco-based interactive science museum, and featured a circular parade and the eating of fruit pies. The Exploratorium continues to hold Pi Day celebrations.</p>

                <p>On March 12, 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a non-binding resolution (111 H. Res. 224), recognizing March 14, 2009, as National Pi Day.</p>
          <p>"Whereas Pi can be approximated as 3.14, and thus March 14, 2009, is an appropriate day for 'National Pi Day': Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives—</p>
          <p>(1) supports the designation of a 'Pi Day' and its celebration around the world;</p>
          <p>(2) recognizes the continuing importance of National Science Foundation's maths and science education programs; and</p>
          <p>(3) encourages schools and educators to observe the day with appropriate activities that teach students about Pi and engage them about the study of mathematics."</p>

                <h2>2012-2014</h2>
                <h3>2012</h3>

                <p>Massachusetts Institute of Technology has often mailed its application decision letters to prospective students for delivery on Pi Day. Starting in 2012, MIT has announced it will post those decisions (privately) online on Pi Day at exactly 6:28 pm, which they have called "Tau Time", to honor the rival numbers pi and tau equally. In 2015, the regular decisions were put online at 9:26 am, following that year's "pi minute", and in 2020, regular decisions were released at 1:59 pm, making the first six digits of pi.</p>

                <h3>March 2014</h3>
                <p>The entire month of March 2014 (3/14) was observed by some as "Pi Month". In the year 2015, March 14 was celebrated as "Super Pi Day". It had special significance, as the date is written as 3/14/15 in month/day/year format. At 9:26:53, the date and time together represented the first 10 digits of π, and later that second Pi Instant represented all of &pi;'s digits.</p>

                        <h2>Alternative dates</h2>
                        <p>Pi Day is most frequently observed on March 14 (3/14 in the month/day format) since 3, 1, and 4 are the first three significant figures of π, but related celebrations have been held on alternative dates.</p>
                        <p>
                  Pi Approximation Day is observed on July 22 (22/7 in the day/month format), since the fraction 22/7 is a common approximation of &pi;, which is accurate to two decimal places and dates from Archimedes.</p>
                  <p>
                  Two Pi Day, also known as Tau Day for the mathematical constant tau, which is approximated as 6.28, is observed on June 28 (6/28 in the month/day format).</p>
                  <p>
                  Pi Approximation Day is also observed on the 10th of November since it is the 314th day of the year.</p>
